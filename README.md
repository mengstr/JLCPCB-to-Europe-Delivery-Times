# JLCPCB-to-Europe-Delivery-Times

## A list of actual delivery times from JLCPCB to Sweden using the cheap &amp; slow shipping option.

When not in a hurry the cheapest shipping option might be a good alternative to the courier freights that usually are at $20 ad upwards. The slow shipping says 12 to 16 business days whish sounds like a lot. IRL shipping to Europe is much faster as the table below shows. Please note that the times are with the weekends included.

Using this shipping option you can get a pack of five 100x100mm PCBs delivered (with the customs and taxes pre-paid so there are no exta fees to pay) for less than $4.50 / EUR 4.10.
