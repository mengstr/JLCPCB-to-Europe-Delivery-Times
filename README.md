# JLCPCB-to-Europe-Delivery-Times

## A list of actual delivery times from JLCPCB to Sweden using the cheap &amp; slow shipping option.

When not in a hurry the cheapest shipping option might be a good alternative to the courier freights that usually are piced at $20-$25 upwards. The slow shipping says 12 to 16 business days which sounds like a lot but in reallity shipping to Europe is much faster as the table below shows. Please note that the times are with the weekends included.
